# BASHWAVE
BASHWAVE (Realname TBA)

Bashwave is an application that makes use of a super-cool-trick with phone providers and emails. 
If you send an email to the right address, your phone service provider will forward it to your cell phone as a text message!
Cool right!

Anyways BASHWAVE (Realname TBA) takes quotes from bash.org (randomly) then seperates them groups them into sets of three (in order to save on emails and text messages), then sends them to an email which is then forwarded to your phone!

BASHWAVE (Realname TBA) doesn't just work the instant you download it. WAIT DON'T LEAVE IT'S REAL EASY! All you gotta do is open up the python script in whatever text editor you want to, the fill out the three variables at the top. There's even comments and arrows and stuff point at them, real easy to find. 

Actually once you get into the script there will be plenty of comments explaining what it is you need to do, which isn't much.
